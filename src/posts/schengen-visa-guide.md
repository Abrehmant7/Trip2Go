# The Ultimate Guide to Schengen Visas (2026 Edition)

Planning a trip to Europe? If you need a visa, navigating the Schengen requirements can be daunting. Here is your essential guide to getting it right in 2026.

## What is a Schengen Visa?
A Schengen Visa allows you to travel freely within the 29 Schengen Area countries for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. This includes popular destinations like France, Italy, Spain, and Germany.

## Key Requirements for 2026

1.  **Valid Passport**: Must be valid for at least 3 months beyond your planned departure from the Schengen area.
2.  **Travel Insurance**: Coverage of at least €30,000 for medical emergencies is mandatory.
3.  **Proof of Accommodation**: Hotel bookings or an invitation letter from a host.
4.  **Flight Itinerary**: Round-trip flight reservations (we can help with this!).
5.  **Financial Means**: Bank statements proving you can support yourself during the trip.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
*   **Applying too late**: Processing times can vary. Apply at least 3-4 weeks in advance.
*   **Incomplete documents**: A single missing document can lead to rejection.
*   **Unclear itinerary**: Consulates want to know your travel plan.
