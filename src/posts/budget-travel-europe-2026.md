# Smart Travel: How to Plan a Budget-Friendly Euro Trip

Europe has a reputation for being expensive, but with smart planning, you can see the sights without breaking the bank. Here is how to travel Europe on a budget in 2026.

## 1. Travel Off-Season
Avoid July and August. The "shoulder seasons" (April-May and September-October) offer beautiful weather, fewer crowds, and significantly cheaper flights and hotels.

## 2. Use Budget Airlines & Trains
Europe is incredibly well-connected. Budget airlines like Ryanair and EasyJet offer flights for as low as €20. Alternatively, the train network is scenic and efficient—look for Eurail passes if you plan to visit multiple countries.

## 3. Eat Like a Local
Skip the tourist trap restaurants near major landmarks. Walk a few blocks away to find authentic local eateries with better food and lower prices. Don't forget street food!

## 4. Book in Advance
Last-minute deals are rare these days. Booking your flights and accommodation 2-3 months in advance is usually the sweet spot for the best prices.

## 5. Free Walking Tours
Most major European cities offer "Free Walking Tours" (tip-based). They are a fantastic way to learn about the city from a local guide without a hefty upfront cost.
